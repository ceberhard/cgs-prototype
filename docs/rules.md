## Cinematic Game System Rules

####Set Up
The players as a group all receieve a deck of cards and a set of percentile dice (pair of d10s). Each player also has their own character sheet representing the role they wish to play during this game session.
The director receives their own deck of cards. The director also has a plot summary sheet which outlines the series of events which will occur if the players fail to intervene in the storyline (*this represents the worst case scenario*).
